## Technologies
- PHP 7
- Laravel 5.3
- Gulp
- Webpack
- Node.js
- MySQL
- Bootstrap
- CSS3/HTML5
- ES6 JS

## Getting Started
Ensure that you have at least Node.js v6 and PHP 7 and MySQL.
To get all depedencies in the root directory, run:
```sh
composer install
npm install
php artisan migrate
```

Adjust all settings as needed in the .env file.
Serve using any way you want such as the official Homestead vm, Apache, or Nginx.
